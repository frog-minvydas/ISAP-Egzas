**<h1>Domain Driven Design</h1>**

**<h4>What is DDD? What issues it attempts to solve, what values does it provide, and what are the main principles of DDD?</h4>**

Domain Driven Design – an approach to software development enabling teams to more effectively manage the construction and maintenance of software for complex problem domains!

Solves issues:
cost centric vs profit centric view on development process
solving problems using technology rather than careful thought and design
database is given too much priority
improper naming of objects and operations
too fast delivery -> lower quality -> big ball of mud
business logic in user interface components and persistence components
broken, slow, and locking database queries 
wrong abstractions
strongly coupled services

Values:

domain model
precise definition and understanding of the business is developed
domain experts contribute to software design 
better user experience is gained 
clean boundaries are placed around pure models 
Enterprise Architecture is better organized
Agile, Iterative, Continuous modelling
new tools, both Strategic and Tactical, are employed

Principles:

Exploration and experimentation
Challenging assumptions
Continuously modelling
No wrong models – practice
Flexible code aids discovery
Problem solver first, technologist second
Don’t solve all the problems
Good is good enough
